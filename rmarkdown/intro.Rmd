## Data governance (Rigde, 2015)

* Use a simple, relatively flat folder lay-out for the project 
* Never edit raw data files received from the client 
* Use a data log to track metadata of received data sets
* Assign a unique ID to each data set received
* Store supporting material near the data 
* Separate the data receipt area from the data manipulation environment (DME) 
* Add row IDs to source data
* Keep original file names 
* Maintain link between data and original file in the DME 
* Load data as plain text and typecast as little as possible 
* Do everything programmatically 
* Load data sets one by one in the DME (i.e. one code file per data set) 
* Keep original columns and add edited versions of a column as a new column 
* Use a simple naming convention for new columns so they can be easily
discriminated from original columns 
* Keep chunks of code simple 
* Indicate the execution order of code in the file name with sequential
numbering
* Use a version control system to manage code versions
* Clean up the DME for each run

## Computing time and machine specs

The system the calculations were performed on:
```{r} 
sessionInfo() 
```

The machine is a 4-core 8 Gb machine running Mint Linux

## Computing time
The computing time for the code to run was ~40 minutes


## Version control

https://www.github.com/maddocent/grinta_lcms

 * Open repository (because the data is a sample)
 * Data and Code Can be easily shared with others
 * Full dataset and computations -> private Repository -> https://www.github.com/uashogeschoolutrecht/grinta_lcms
 
## Increasing computational power:

 * Complete dataset has:
```{r} 
 44*5*75
``` 
 amount of Mb storage needed.
 * Total computing power on current machine for complete dataset ~
```{r} 
 5*40
``` 
 minutes
 
 * Multiple iterations, waiting time becomed too big
 * Options: 
  - Surf: multiple options, seems difficult to arrange
  - iLab: "UU Bioinformatics Centre" -> possibly best option
 
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
